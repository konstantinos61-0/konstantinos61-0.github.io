    <p>
      Hello there, what's your favorite season? Mine is spring.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Nature is blooming with beautiful, colorful plans and flowers
        filling up the atmosphere with all sorts of refreshing fragrances.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sun is shining!
      </li>
      <li>
        the temperature is perfect for little trips
        to Nature and everything is perfect.
      </li>
    </ul>

      gave me allergies. My nose is itchy and I'm sneezing unstoppably while
      tears are running out of my eyes. In a desperate attempt for redemption I
      reach inside my bag for tissues only to find out i didn't bring any.
      I guess that's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dYNttdgl0">life</a>.
